    2. mine placement (randomised depth first search)
    3. adj to mine counting 
    4. user input handling 
    5. cell reveal logic 
    6. game and conditions
    7. flagging mechanism

- additional features:
    1. timer
    2. difficulty 
    3. reveal all mines + incorrect flags 
    4. scoring system
    5. abort game to reveal board 

- future enhancements:
