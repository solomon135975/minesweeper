game grid initialisation 
- how do i represent the grid
- how will i initalise each cell's state

grid {
    Cell[9][9] grid;
    numMines = 10;
    numFlags = numMines;

    print "  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 " 

    for y = 0; y<9; y++ {
        char row = 'a' + y 
        print row + " "
        
        for x = 0; x<9; x++ {
            grid [y][x] = new Cell();
            print " " + grid[y][x].getDisplay() + " ";
        }
        print newLine
    }
}

Cell {
    boolean isMine = false;
    boolean isRevealed = false;
    int numMines = 0;
    String value = "."
    boolean isFlagged = false;
    String display = "#";

    methods:
    setMine()
    setRevealed()
    setFlagged()
    getDisplay()
    getValue()
    getNumMines()

}


mine placement:
- discuss the steps for the randomised depth first search 
- how will i ensure mine placement is random (by using rdfs)

randomised depth first search:
1. starting point: player chooses first cell
2. ensure this cell is not a mine (it isn't because we haven't set any yet), mark as revealed
3. start dfs from this first cell, mark immediate surrounding cells as revealed as well (they will not be bombs)
4. from the neighbours, start the dfs and place mines in them or from them etc
5. continue placing bombs until max num bombs reached

when a mine is placed, increment value of non-mine cells around it


user input handling:
- how will i prompt the user
- what kind of inputs am i expecting and how will i deal with invalid inputs 
- differentiate between a reveal and a flag action 

while input not q (because that means quit)
do:
    trim and lower input
    check if last character of input isDigit
    if isDigit, then we are revealing a cell
        row = charAt(0)
        column is substring (1, length)
        check if this row and column exist in the grid
            otherwise output invalid input, prompt to do again
        reveal 
    else if not isDigit, dealing with flagging 
        row = charAt(0)
        action = charAt(length - 1)
        column is substring (1, length -1)
        check if column or row or action invalid 
            otherwise output invalid input, take new input
        mark cell as flagged or unflagged if already flagged
    else if q: quit
    print updated grid and ask for new input 


flagging mechanism:
- how will i represent a flagged cell
- what happens if a user flags an already flagged cell

ok so flagged cell represented by a !
if a user flags an already flagged cell, then it unflags

if action == 'f' 
    cell.setFlagged()

setFlagged() {  //in cell class probably
    if isRevealed == true {
        return
    }
    if display == "#" {
        isFlagged = true
        display = "!"
    }
    else if display == "!" {
        isFlagged = false
        display = "#"
    }
}


cell reveal logic:
- what should happen if a cell is revealed
- how will i handle the cascade reveal for cells with no adjacent mines
- how will i manage edge cases, like for when a cell is on the border of the grid

if cell is chosen, change display to value of cell
    if value == "X" game over
        set isRevealed = true
        set gameOver = true
    if display != "#"
        return
    if value == "0"
        set isRevealed = true
        recursively reveal cells around it as long as their numMines also = 0 and reveal their surrounds as well. exclude isFlagged = true
        stop recursion if isRevealed = true, if isFlagged = true, if numMines > 0
    if value > 0
        set isRevealed = true
        reveal cell
        display = numMines

print new grid


game end conditions:
- how will i determine if a mine is clicked
- what criteria determines a win
- how will i communicate this to the player
