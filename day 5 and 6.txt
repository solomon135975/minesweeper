Working on finishing grid class:
needs methods to manipulate grid:
    reveal cell
    flag cell?
    check for mines around a cell
    print grid
    reset grid 
    check is move valid

MineGenerator class needed

all i did was plan what methods need to go in grid

11 Sept 2023

realised grid class also needs these methods:
    makeMove()
    checkMove()
    mineClicked()
    allMinesFlagged()
    allSafeCellsRevealed()
    numRevealedCells()
    numMinesFlagged()

coded most of the methods, need to do print grid, gameOver that those 2
made MineGenerator class to work with soon

gameOver should go in Minesweeps class

PRINTGRID() WORKS THAT IS ALL I CARE ABOUT RN GOAL IS WITHIN REACH RN
finished all other methods, still need to test them
